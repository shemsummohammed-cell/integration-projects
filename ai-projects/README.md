# AI Projects: Generative & Agentic AI
This folder will contain learning projects and examples exploring Generative AI and Agentic AI.

- **Generative AI:** Focuses on creating text, images, or code using models like GPT or Stable Diffusion.
- **Agentic AI:** Focuses on systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously based on goals.

Future projects may include building small prototypes with Python and OpenAI API.
