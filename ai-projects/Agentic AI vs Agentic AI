Generative vs Agentic AI: Shaping the Future of AI Collaboration

Generative AI
  Works in a prompt → output mode (reactive).
  Generates content such as text, images, or code.
  Focuses on creativity, ideation, and expression.
  Example: ChatGPT creating text or code when prompted.

Agentic AI
  Goal-driven and proactive — plans, acts, and adapts autonomously.
  Integrates reasoning, memory, and external tools/APIs.
  Can perform multi-step tasks without constant human input.
  Example: An AI that books travel, manages schedules, or executes workflows.
