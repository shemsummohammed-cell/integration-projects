IBM MQ Fundamentals - Interview Ready Review
Core Architecture Components
Queue Manager
Definition: The primary component that manages queues, channels, and message flow
Functions: 
Controls access to queues and manages message storage
Provides transaction support and message recovery
Manages channels and network connections
Handles security authentication and authorization
Key Point: One queue manager per MQ installation (unless clustered)
Queues (Storage Objects)
Local Queues:s
Physical storage for messages on the local queue manager
Messages are stored until consumed by applications
Types: Normal, transmission, dead letter, initiation
Remote Queues:
Local definition that points to a queue on another queue manager
Provides location transparency for applications
Contains routing information (remote queue manager name and queue name)
Alias Queues:
Alternative name for an existing local or remote queue
Used for application flexibility and queue redirection
Model Queues:
Templates for creating temporary dynamic queues
Applications can create temporary queues based on model definitions
Transmission Queues (XMITQ):
Special local queues that temporarily hold messages destined for remote queue managers
Acts as a staging area before messages are sent through channels
One transmission queue typically serves one remote queue manager
The sender channel reads messages from the transmission queue and transfers them to the remote system
Naming convention: Usually named after the remote queue manager (e.g., QM2.XMITQ for messages going to QM2)

Channels (Communication Links)
Sender Channel (SDR):
Initiates connection to receiver channel
Pushes messages from transmission queue to remote system
Receiver Channel (RCVR):
Accepts connections from sender channels
Receives messages and places them in target queues
Server Connection Channel (SVRCONN):
Allows MQ client applications to connect to queue manager
Handles client requests and responses
Client Connection Channel (CLNTCONN):
Client-side definition for connecting to SVRCONN channel
Contains connection details (hostname, port, channel name)
Server Channel (SVR):
Bidirectional channel for server-to-server communication
Less common, used for specific integration patterns
Requester Channel (RQSTR):
Requests connection from sender channel
Pull model instead of push model
Messages
Message Structure:
Message Descriptor (MQMD): Contains routing and control information
Message Data: The actual application payload
Properties: Additional metadata (JMS properties, user properties)
Message Types:
Request: Expecting a response
Reply: Response to a request message
Report: System-generated status messages
Datagram: One-way message, no response expected
Messaging Patterns
Point-to-Point
Definition: Direct communication between two applications
Characteristics: 
One producer, one consumer
Message consumed by only one application
Guaranteed delivery and ordered processing
Uses local queues for message storage
Publish/Subscribe
Definition: One-to-many communication pattern
Characteristics: 
Publishers send messages to topics
Subscribers receive messages from topics they subscribe to
Multiple subscribers can receive same message
Decoupled communication (publishers don't know subscribers)
Topic Objects:
Administrative Topics: Pre-defined by administrator
Topics: Hierarchical structure (e.g., /Finance/Orders/NewOrder)
Subscription Types:
Durable: Survives queue manager restart, receives messages even when disconnected
Non-durable: Lost when application disconnects
Message Delivery and Persistence
Delivery Guarantees
At-Most-Once:
Message delivered zero or one time
Possible message loss, no duplicates
Fastest performance
At-Least-Once:
Message delivered one or more times
No message loss, possible duplicates
Requires duplicate detection by application
Exactly-Once:
Message delivered exactly one time
No loss, no duplicates
Highest overhead, strongest guarantee
Message Persistence
Persistent Messages:
Written to disk/transaction logs
Survive queue manager restart
Higher overhead but guaranteed delivery
Non-Persistent Messages:
Kept in memory only
Better performance but lost on restart
Used for real-time, replaceable data
Transactions and Units of Work
Local Transactions
Single queue manager transactions
MQBEGIN, MQCOMMIT, MQBACK commands
All-or-nothing message processing
Global Transactions
Span multiple resource managers (databases, queue managers)
XA transaction support
Two-phase commit protocol
Syncpoints
Commit/rollback points in message processing
Ensures message and database consistency
Critical for transactional applications
Security Model
Authentication
Connection Authentication: Who can connect to queue manager
Types: Operating system users, LDAP, custom authentication
Authorization
Object Authority Manager (OAM): Controls access to MQ objects
Permissions: Connect, browse, get, put, set, delete, etc.
Principal: User or group being granted/denied access
Channel Security
Channel Authentication (CHLAUTH): Controls channel access
SSL/TLS: Encryption and certificate-based authentication
Channel Exit Programs: Custom security processing
Common Administrative Objects
Listeners
Purpose: Monitor ports for incoming connections
Default: SYSTEM.DEFAULT.LISTENER.TCP on port 1414
Commands: START LISTENER, STOP LISTENER
Name Lists
Collections of cluster or authentication information names
Used for grouping related configuration items
Process Objects
Define how trigger programs are started
Used with triggered queues for automated processing
Services
Programs that start/stop with queue manager
Used for monitoring applications or custom processes
Key Commands (RUNMQSC)
Queue Manager Commands
DISPLAY QMGR - Show queue manager attributes
ALTER QMGR - Modify queue manager settings
PING QMGR - Test queue manager responsiveness
Queue Commands
DEFINE QLOCAL(queue.name) - Create local queue
DISPLAY QUEUE(queue.name) - Show queue attributes
PUT queue.name - Put test message (interactive mode)
GET queue.name - Get message from queue (interactive mode)
Channel Commands

STOP CHANNEL(channel.name) - Stop channel
Interview Key Points
Always distinguish between logical and physical objects
Understand message flow through channels and queues
Know the difference between client and server connections
Be clear about persistence vs. delivery guarantees
Understand transaction boundaries and syncpoints
Know security layers: authentication, authorization, encryption








IBM MQ on AWS EC2 - Complete Installation Guide
1. System Prerequisites (Critical Interview Topic)
Kernel Parameters (Must Know!)
# Add to /etc/sysctl.conf
kernel.shmmni = 4096
kernel.shmmax = 268435456
kernel.shmall = 2097152
kernel.sem = 32 4096 32 128
fs.file-max = 524288
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300
Why These Matter:
kernel.shmmni: Maximum shared memory segments (MQ uses shared memory)
kernel.shmmax: Maximum shared memory segment size
kernel.sem: Semaphore limits for process synchronization
fs.file-max: Maximum open files (MQ handles many concurrent connections)
